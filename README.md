# Motivations
1. The most important reason that i started this project is to satisfy: `curiosity` and `Eager for a deeper understanding` senses.
2. If you came from UNIX world, working with window ecosystem is a frustrating experience. CMD as a shell is awful. Even i started [winmagics](https://github.com/LinArcX/winmagics) to hack it.
	But very soon i realized that it's better to create my own world on top of windows and live inside it.
3. I always appreciate people that encourage other people to learn more. So i invite you to hack `ush` and make your own version of it :)

# Build
You can use different build-systems(gnu-make or visual-studio 2005) with different configurations.(x86,64 | debug,release).
But before compiling you need some tools:

## Build dependencies
- git
- clang(gcc or msvc)
- gnu-make(or visual-studio)

# TODO
- [] implement `pwd`.
- [] implement `mkdir`.
- [] implement `touch`.
- [] implement `ls`.
- [] let prompt change from `ush.h`.
